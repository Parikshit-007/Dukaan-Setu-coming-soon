  <h1>Account Deletion and Data Removal</h1>
  <p class="muted">Dukaan Setu</p>

  <p>You can request deletion of your Dukaan Setu account and associated personal data at any time. Follow the steps below.</p>

  <h2>How to request deletion</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Open the app and go to <span class="mono">Profile → Account → Delete Account</span>, or</li>
    <li>Email us at <a href="mailto:support@dukaansetu.com">support@dukaansetu.com</a> with the subject “Delete my account” from your registered email/phone.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>What we delete</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Account profile (name, email/phone, saved addresses)</li>
    <li>Favorites, bookmarks, cart data</li>
    <li>Push notification tokens linked to your user</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What we may retain</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Order records and invoices needed for accounting, tax, fraud prevention, or legal compliance</li>
    <li>Server logs and aggregated analytics that do not personally identify you</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Retention for the above is limited to what is required by law or legitimate business purposes. Typical retention for invoices and tax records is up to <strong>25 days</strong> before archival or anonymization, unless a longer period is legally required in your jurisdiction.</p>

  <h2>Verification</h2>
  <p>We may ask you to verify your identity (for example, via OTP/email confirmation) to protect your account from unauthorized deletion.</p>

  <h2>Timeline</h2>
  <p>We begin processing your request immediately and complete deletion of eligible data within <strong>25 days</strong>. Records retained for legal reasons are archived and no longer used for product features.</p>
